# Code Style

- Code style needs to be consistent accross all developers
  - Enforced by using auto formatting, and having consistent settings for development environments
  - Adopting language specific default style (e.g. `dart` has its own default style).
- Utilize syntax checkers and spell checkers
  - Syntax checkers/linters e.g. markdownlint extension for VS Code
  - Check spelling via available plugins/extensions for your dev environment (e.g. cSpell)
